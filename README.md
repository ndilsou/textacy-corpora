# Textacy-Corpora

A companion library to [Textacy](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) that facilitate working with multiple or
large corpora. It is inspired from the CategorizedCorpus of NLTK.

Textacy-Corpora provides a **TextCorpora** class that acts as a wrapper around a collection of labeled **Corpus**.
Most of the manipulation available on the Corpus can be applied on the TextCorpora as is.
